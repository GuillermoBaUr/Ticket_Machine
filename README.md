# Ticket Machine Application

This repository contains the source code for a ticket machine application developed in Python using the Tkinter library.

## Description

The ticket machine application initializes and sets up the main window, loads background images, creates the screen and buttons, and runs the main loop.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This module initializes the ticket machine application, sets up the main window, loads background images, creates the screen and buttons, and starts the main loop.
- `image_loader.py`: Module responsible for loading background images.
- `screen.py`: Module responsible for creating the application screen to display the program output.
- `buttons.py`: Module responsible for creating the application buttons.
- `turns.py`: Module responsible for handling the turns algorithm for each button.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and intuitive interface for ticket selection.
- **Turn Management**: Implements an algorithm to handle turns for multiple buttons.
- **Image-based Design**: Uses background images and styled buttons for a better user experience.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate components for screen, buttons, image loading, and turn logic.
- **Lightweight**: Runs efficiently on standard Python environments.

## Video Demonstration

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **UI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Concepts**: Event-driven programming, modular design
- **Assets**: Image-based UI elements
